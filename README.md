# Marketing Management

## Campaign Objective
The objective of this course is to execute practical marketing strategies with the professor as the target audience. A key element of this marketing campaign involves selecting one group member as the central figure. The primary goal is to effectively promote this student to the professor, ensuring that the professor not only acknowledges their presence but also remembers them by the conclusion of the semester.

## Implementation Strategy
Our group's primary objective is to highlight the student's qualities by drawing a parallel with a "mother" figure. This approach entails active engagement in the classroom, including frequent participation by raising hands and engaging in discussions with the professor during breaks. Moreover, the student intends to dress uniquely on Halloween to capture the professor's attention. This strategic approach has yielded positive outcomes, as the professor has acknowledged our efforts. Given that the professor is often engaged in research activities in the United States and spends minimal time on campus, we adapt the posting schedule on our Facebook page to align with the professor's local time zone. Furthermore, on special occasions such as holidays, we ensure timely communication with the professor through emails, providing valuable information on family-friendly travel destinations during Thanksgiving.

## Responsibilities
Version 1: In my role, I am primarily accountable for tasks such as composing compelling content, editing videos and photos, as well as generating ideas for social media posts. This entire process has taught me the significance of not only emphasizing the attributes of the product but also establishing a meaningful connection between the product's qualities and the everyday lives of consumers. This connection is vital to create a sense of resonance.

# 行銷管理

## 作業目標
本課程的需要真實的去做行銷，對象是授課教授，主要的行銷主角時組內的其一成員。可以透過任何方式，向老師做宣傳，並要讓老師在學期末時認識並記住這位成員。

## 實行想法
我們小組主要想宣傳的是該同學向「媽媽」一樣的特質。宣傳的手法是上課多舉手發言，並在教授中途下課時多與他聊天。在萬聖節前夕利用特殊打扮抓教授眼球，此策略效果還不錯，教授有注意到我們。由於大部分的時間教授前往美國做研究並不在學校中，所以我們會將粉絲專頁發文的時間調整至當地時區，在特殊節日時寄送時宜的郵件給教授，像是感恩節時提供教授所在地的一些適合全家大小共同旅遊的地點等。

## 負責工作
我是主要負責撰寫文案、剪輯影片、照片編輯以及發想貼文的人。在這之中我學到除了要緊扣產品的特質外，也需要將產品的特質與消費者的日常生活做結合，才能達到共鳴。
